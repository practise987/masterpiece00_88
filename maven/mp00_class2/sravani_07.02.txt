1.what is plugin?
sol: In maven 'archetype' is a plugin

2.what is goal?
sol: In maven 'generate' is a goal

3.what is groupId?
sol: groupId  is nothing but a url of your project, and it always be in a reverse order
 ex:com.flipkart.www
 
4.what is artifactId?
sol: artifactId  is the name of your project

5.what is version?
sol: version is nothing but release of your project. for first release the version  will be like this,
        -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT  --1.0 means first release

6.pom.xml?

sol:for every project, while creating folder structure maven will generate one script file   called  pom.xml . and it contains the information about the project and configuration details. the pom.xml file will looks like this,
  
ex:

<project>
     
      <modelversion>4.0.0</modelversion>
      <groupId>com.geestract00</groupId>
      <artifactId>onlineshopping</artifactId>
       <packaging>jar</packaging>
       <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
       <name>onlineshopping</name>
       <url>http://maven.apache.org</url>
      <dependencies>
           <dependency>
               <groupId>junit</groupId>
               <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
               <version>3.8.1</version>
               <scope>test</test>
            <dependency>
      </dependencies>

</project>

-->when executing the goal,first maven reads the pom.xml file and gets the needed configuration information then executes the goal.  
    
 
          

7.what is the (basic) folder structure of maven?
Sol: for each application the folder structure will be different.
     For standalone application applications,the folder structure looks like this,


    onlineshopping--- 1.pom.xml
                      2.src---1.main--java--com--geestract00--app.java
                               2.test--java--com--geestract00--apptest.java
      
--> here onlineshopping is artifactId and geestract00 is groupId.
                
8.command to create the folder structure?
sol: mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId= url of project -DartifactId=name of project -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT -DinteractiveMode=false

----> here if we didn't mentioned  '-DinteractiveMode=false' this one,it will ask some questions like groupId,artifactId,version  to proceed or not.
so,if you   want to create a folder structure with the mentioned specifications without asking these questions,we have to mention the 'interactiveMode=false'
 

9.differences between maven and ant?
sol:
  ----> in maven
      -->we no need to create any folderstructures manually, it will create automatically by using the command.and it creates its own pom.xml file
     --->maven folder structure is like this,

      onlineshopping--- 1.pom.xml
                        2.src---1.main--java--com--geestract00--app.java
                                2.test--java--com--geestract00--apptest.java

 ----->in ant
    -->we have to write script name called build.xml  for creating folder structures 
    --->ant folder structure is like this,

             ant---1.build.xml
                   2.sources--.java files
                   3.build---.class files
